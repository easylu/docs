title: Fully-managed instance (trot.to)
---

The Trotto team manages an instance of Trotto at [trot.to](https://trot.to/_/auth/login), which is free for up to
10 users. It's been humming along for years and is used by
companies [like Figma](/blog/2020/08/05/how-figma-uses-trotto-go-links).

If you'd rather we manage your Trotto instance for you, [try it out](https://trot.to/_/auth/login).
