title: Adminstrators
---

Administrators are able to [edit](editing-a-go-link) or [delete](deleting-a-go-link) any
go link, regardless of who [owns](go-link-owners) the go link.

Adminstrators are configured via the [`admins` key](/docs/deploy/app-yml-config-file#admins-optional)
in the [`app.yml`](../deploy/app-yml-config-file) config file. If you're using
[fully-managed Trotto](../deploy/fully-managed), email [help@trot.to](mailto:help@trot.to) to set up administrators for
your organization.
