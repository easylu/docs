title: Go links directory
---

Any user can view, search, and sort all the go links in their organization by clicking `Directory`
in the top nav.

For users of [fully-managed Trotto](../deploy/fully-managed), the directory also shows the number
of unique [visits](using-a-go-link) to a go link, and the directory is by default sorted
leaderboard-style, from most to least used go link.
