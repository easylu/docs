title: Editing a go link

A go link's [owner](go-link-owners) or an [adminstrator](administrator-role) can
change the destination of the go link at any time.

This is one of the great benefits of go links: As the definitive URL for a resource changes, you
can simply update the destination of the go link without the need to socialize a new URL. For
example, you could update `go/allhands` each week to point to the agenda or Q&A for that week's
company all-hands.
