title: Creating a go link
---

You can quickly create a go link by either typing a not-yet-created go link into your address
bar or going to [go/](http://go) or [trot.to](https://trot.to). If you try to use a non-existent
go link, that go link will be auto-populated in the go link creation form.

## Keyword requirements

The keyword for a go link can include any combination of letters, numbers, and dashes (`-`). Go
links are case-insensitive, so `go/OKRs` is the same as `go/okrs`.

## Destination URL requirements

A go link can be any URL. If no protocol is provided, HTTP will be assumed. For instance, if
the provided URL is `docs.google.com`, the destination will be stored as `http://docs.google.com`.
