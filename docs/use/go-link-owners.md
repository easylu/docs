title: Go link owners
---

Each go link has an owner, who is able to [edit](editing-a-go-link) or [delete](deleting-a-go-link) the
go link. Any user can view the owner of the go link in the [go links directory](go-links-directory).

The owner of a go link is by default the user who created the go link.
